      <p> Hello! My name is Cam Riemensnider and I'm a Masters in Computer and Information Technology candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Through an internship with Lob, I'm hoping to become a stronger software engineer, get hands-on experience with production-level code, and get further experience working with teams of software engineers.</p>
      <p>I came to develop an interest in software engineering in a non-traditional environment: law school. During law school at Washington University in St. Louis my studies focused on legal issues surrounding technology including patents, data privacy, intellectual property, and technical startups. During these courses, my passion for technology was ignited and I began a transition into software engineering.</p>
      <p>Software engineering excites me as a career path because of its potential to help solve real-world problems and because of its intellectually challenging nature. I love that technologies are constantly evolving and that remaining a strong developer means a passion for continual learning.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm most interested in creating software that helps automate repetitive business tasks. When I was working as a legal recruiter, 50% of my day was spent doing small, repetitive tasks which, if automated, would have saved me a lot of time! Within this broad umbrella, my principal technological interests currently lay in natural language processing, web development, machine learning, and systems engineering.</p>
      <p>I hope to be a part of the Lobster family soon!</p>
